What's a datapond, you might ask? 
It's a bit like a data lake, but much smaller, and organized a little better. 

For my Rails CMS project, I'm creating a place to store outstanding research and analytics documentation, from reputable data providers.

In this site, a user can create data packages, i.e. recent news from Google, stock price trends from Bloomberg, market capitalization from S&P, industry level trends and competitors from IBISWorld, etc... 

Users can then create documents that are associated with a particular data package. Under the market cap trends package from S&P, there may be associated analyst reports, for example. 

Whenever a user makes a data package, it gets added to the wall of packages, for all users to see. 

A user can favorite a data package, add notes to help them rememeber why this particular package was so great, and access this bookmark of favorites at any time.
