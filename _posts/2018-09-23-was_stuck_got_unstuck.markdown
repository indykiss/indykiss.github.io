I tend to obsess. When I come across a problem, I won't leave it alone until I find the answer. Hours, days, sometimes weeks depending on the project. 

Then I met regex. 

Part of my job is building out search querys to conduct research to support very specific theses. 
Regex should be easy. 
It's not. At least, it wasn't for me. 

Despite understanding the basics- Regex uses a syntatic formula to precisely find matching data within a dataset- I was unable to finetune the boolean.ish regex code to search for exactly what I needed. The lab tests weren't passing. Three or four conversations with the TAs didn't help. Two... three... four cups of coffee later... 

I moved on. For several weeks. 

Came back, with the thought of reading more casual explanations of the subject, which led to regex101.com and the rediscovery of rubular.com. 

Things clicked. Tests passed. Time for the next challenge.
