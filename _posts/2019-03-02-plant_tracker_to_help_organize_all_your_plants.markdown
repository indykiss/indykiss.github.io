Are you an crazy plant lady who likes to spend your Saturday mornings in the farmer's market picking out a new plant to add to your ever-shrinking, 0.25 bedroom NYC apartment? Do you lose the care tag for each plant as soon as you bring it home, lost in the dirt or trash... did the dog eat it again!?

Me too!

Hence the plant tracker, my Sinatra project. 

The plant tracker allows you to log in and add a plant with its care details (plant name, water needed, light needed). In case you also add decorations to plants (found a pretty rock on a hike? put it in the same pot as the fig tree)!, you can also track those. If you ever move the rock to a different plant, or find out that your philodendron doesn't *really* need that much sun, you can edit as needed.
