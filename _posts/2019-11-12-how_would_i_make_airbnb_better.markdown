Today, I was asked to do a really interesting product analysis, deep diving into a product’s features. 

I picked Airbnb after reading a few articles about the dichotomy between their recent UNESCO site promotions (spend a night on the Great Wall of China? in the Paris Catacombs?) and the recent shooting at an Airbnb “party house” that ended with five deaths, which thankfully Airbnb is responding to by adding extra layers of regulation to prevent in the future. Will get back into that regulation thought towards the end of this blog article, but will begin with what Airbnb products are excelling in and in what they can do better. 


## What does the Airbnb application do well? 

From a user’s perspective, Airbnb excels at the clarity of its metadata structure for their partnering homes. Users can find the exact situation they’re looking for, whether that’s a treehouse in the middle of a jungle or a NYC studio in a high-rise. Airbnb’s product makes this data discovery extremely easy; allowing clear filtering by a variety of parameters, list view vs map view, elevating certain hosts to Superhosts, posting all reviews with clear rating system, etc. 

The product utilizes modern technologies to make this search experience seamless and intuitive on the desktop and on mobile, across all browsers. In an ecosystem of Booking.coms and Pricelines, each with a suite of random pop-ups, it’s refreshing to see an ad-free, beautifully minimualistic experience that a user can expect to be authentic and honest while providing the search mechanisms they need. 


## What should the application improve upon, from its existing features? 

Currently, Airbnb has four main products; Stays, Experiences, Adventures, and Restaurants. In particular, I’m curious about how to better leverage the Restaurants feature. The other three have a clear objective; Stays are equivalent to hotels, Experiences are ½ day – full day trips, Adventures are multi-day trips. 

Currently, the Restaurants line acts as a review source and allows a user to add the restaurant to a trip outline, but the product ends there, without too much of a value add. The rest of Airbnb’s experiences are personal; they provide interaction with locals, helping build a community amongst the users and the hosts. Restaurants could be expanded upon to provide a back-door experience, maybe simply adding the specials for that day or learning from a chef about how to make their signature dish. 

If we take that second thought; nestling an experience into making a dinner reservation, the specs to add that to the Restaurants feature could be pretty simple, leveraged the existing framework from their Experiences product.

By adding more interactivity into their Restaurants feature, Airbnb’s products as a whole can speak more to their goal of making users feel at home everywhere.



## What new feature could Airbnb implement and how would I integrate that new feature into the application? 


There’s a market opportunity for Airbnb to add alternative venues for corporate offsites, ranging from vineyards to yoga studios to wellness centers.  At the moment, there’s really only two options for offsite meetings; hotel conference rooms or bars/restaurants. Many companies struggle to organize out of the box meetings for their employees and clients. 

With the assumption of already having internal stakeholder buy-in, I’d conduct market research to see if customers (tiered by highly loyal, loyal, and non-users) would consider booking a corporate event through the platform, sending out surveys, conducting interviews, and building customer experience maps globally. I’d do the same for hosts for alternative spaces as well, to ensure that Airbnb can provide a supply if there is a demand. 

If there is both, I would create a new product that sits alongside their Stays, Experiences, Adventures, and Restaurants products, maybe called Offsites. 

Airbnb is adding more regulation to their Stays product to build trust amongst its users after the most recent tragedy. For Offsites, I would implement a similar regulation practice, but requiring more paperwork to ensure the safety of both users and hosts. Users would need to provide context around the event (what organization? catering? number of people; their names? description of event?) and possibly pay a small deposit. Spaces will be properly vetted to meet Airbnb standards (basics like wifi and cleanliness? open hours for users to visit? is location staffed?). 

To drive adoption, I’d consider reaching out to large corporations— the Googles, Amazons, Palantirs, and McKinseys of the world— to provide a few complimentary offsites to gain some news traction and maybe a few references. 

A personal, yet organization-focused product that offers alternative venues would be the first of its kind. It would both create a new revenue stream and would make event organizers’ lives easier. 



## What I learned 

This was a great thought experience, looking at a product, seeing what it does well and what it can improve on, then positing an innovative new feature that can add business value and impact peoples' lives. 

As this is the sort of project I'd like to work on in my next role, I need to think more about how to analytically approach a product, note its strengths and weaknesses, and possible areas of improvement-- and all the details involved in each phase. 

I'd love to dive more into best practices for this sort of problem solving, and how to add in my own portfolio of experiences to drive change. More research needed!
