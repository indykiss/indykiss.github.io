There are quite a few bookmarked cheat sheets that I've found super useful in understanding the mechanics of Ruby.
Here's just a few!


* Good for understanding basics and a few important methods, like the difference between .gsub and .sub:

* For a bit more detailed views of Ruby basics (see left for table of contents!) I really liked the hash explanation, for example:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/index.htm 

* For regex, specifically: 
https://regex101.com/

* Whenever there's a particular subject that I didn't understand, I tended to look to medium or youtube to help explain the issue I'm having. The powers of knowledge sharing!
