It's been a VERY long time since I've written. Lots of things have changed since then, both globally and personally. 

In March and April, during the peak of Covid in NYC, sirens rang out every minute of every day as I sat helplessly in my 550 sq ft apartment. 911 dispatchers were receiving more calls for covid than they had received during 9/11. Except it happened every day for weeks. The energy in the city and in my heart reflected that fact. 

After seeing most of friends leaving, I decided that that would be the best thing to do for myself as well. So in May, I booked the least populated flight to Alaska at 6am on a Tuesday; definitely the most reckless thing I've done during the quarantine, but the best thing I could've done for myself. Stepping away from the summer gave me more space to cope and to breathe. 

I decided to spend the summer in Girdwood, Alaska- the maximum amount of social distancing possible, with the highest tree to person ratio I've ever seen. I've spent those months time hiking, canoeing, camping, fishing (halibut, trout and salmon!), seeing lots of bears and breathing in the fresh air. I was even able to catch the northern lights for a brief but breathtaking 5 minutes! 

It was a lovely time away, but I'm back home in September and refocusing on programming on a more regular basis. The global crises continues, so I'm actively pursuing volunteering programs for the effort. I'd love for some of my renewed energy to go towards improving the world. (If you have any ideas, please let me know!) 

I hope you've been doing as well as you can during these tough times. <3
