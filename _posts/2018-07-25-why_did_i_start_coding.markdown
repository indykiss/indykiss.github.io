When I worked on my psychology senior thesis in college, I did a tiny bit of coding in Matlab. I really enjoyed the experience, but didn't really know what to do with that knowledge. Then I became a researcher at a consulting agency, and realized just how useful coding could be. I'm now learning how to code to help melt together my love of data and my love of solving analytical problems.
