When I worked on my psychology senior thesis in college, I did a tiny bit of coding in Matlab and did some data analysis in R. I happily spent long nights coding while my friends celebrated. By the end of the thesis, I was hooked but wasn't able to dive very deeply into programming. While at undergrad, I vocationally studied library science and went down that route to a digital librarianship position at a consulting agency, where I am now.

In this position, I've needed fullstack programming capabilities for everything from frontend email templates to backed Salesforce API integrations. Having just touched these aspects occasionally, I've realized that I want to pursue this more fully. 

So I enrolled in the Flatiron school to learn how to melt together my love of data and my love of solving analytical problems.
