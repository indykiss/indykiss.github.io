As I deepen my basic knowledge of JavaScript and all things code, I'm going to deep dive into a Q & A series of blogs for core computer science concepts, theories and principles, JS concepts and algorithmic strategies. 

This first blog will be a bit of a board of ideas that I'll flesh out more as the weeks go by. 

Excited to learn more about the theory behind the code! 



**Basics**

*What is a data structure?*
* A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. In Javascript, the primitive data types are numbers, strings, boolean, undefined and null. Objects like functions and arrays are non-primitive structures. Main difference is that primitive data structures are immutable while non-primitices are mutable. 
 
*Why wrap code in functions?*
* Wrapping code in functions allows for easy reference later on and allows us to keep code ensapulated, which is important to keep scope organized. 
 
*What is a hash table?*
* A hash table is a dictionary type data structure that maps keys to values. It allows people to look up a value based off its key. 

*What is a stack?* 
* A stack is a collection of elements that is based on a last in, last out policy. There are two principle operations; push, which adds an element, and pop, which takes off an element. 

*What's the difference between a stack and an array?*
* An array is a collection of similar data type, identified by index, while a stack is a linear data structure that represents sequential collection of element in fixed order. The main difference is access. You can access any element in an array by using indices. You can't access all the elements in a stack; you can only get the element at the top using push and pop. 

*What is a queue*
* A queue is a data linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. Essentially, like a queue of people trying to buy stuff; first in, first out. 

*What's a priority queue?*
* A queue, which instead of operating on a first come, first out order, operates on a priority basis. 

*What is a heap?*
* A tree-based data structure that effeciently implements a priority queue, first-in/first-out. 

*What is a min and a max heap?*
* A max heap is when, in a heap, the parent nodes are higher than its children nodes. A min heap is the opposite, where children nodes are higher than its parent nodes. 

*What is the difference between a heap and priority queue?*
* Heaps are used to implement priority queues. A heap's shape as well as its order (min vs max) are its two main properties.
