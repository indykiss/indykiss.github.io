Datapond is a platform for sharing news and market data to facilitate analytics. Datapond allows users to create an account through Datapond or through Facebook. Once logged in, they can create and view data packages and associated documents. Any particularly good data package can be favorited by the user, to be accessed later. 

I built Datapond as my Rails project and now I'm beginning to think about how to build on it to complete my Javascript project. 
 
The next step in building out datapond is to add in some Javascript components. One thing I can do is make a dynamic Category index page, such that each Category (when clicked) presents the data packages under the Category without reloading. A *News* category might have data packages from Reuters, Bloomberg and Factiva, for example. 

Another dynamic feature to add could be favoriting a data package. It's currently a standalone page, but it might be nicer as a small pop-up window. Or there's just a heart icon, where (when clicked), presents a Notes field to fill in. 

Lots to think about!
